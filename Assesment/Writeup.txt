Q.  Write a program to create Arithmetic calculator.



 The program is created using the Eclipse IDE and run on the Command prompt as well
      There was errors found after run the program successfully, when dividing the any number with zero to resolve this issue I used the Exception handler try and catch function.
Now the program is run without errors.
